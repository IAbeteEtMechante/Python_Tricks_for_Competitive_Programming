# Python_Tricks_for_Competitive_Programming
This repo is like a bag of tricks in Python, that are not really algos, but are usefull to know for CP.

Also check some ideas of [things to think about](https://github.com/IAbeteEtMechante/Python_Tricks_for_Competitive_Programming/blob/main/Things_to_think_about.md)

## Arrays of numbers
1. Group identical consecutive values
2. Counter (frequency array)
3. Prefix sums

## Binary numbers
1. Convert string to binary
2. Display fixed number of bits
3. Inverse all bits

## Strings
1. Ascii
2. Group identical consecutive chars


## Misc
1. Sets (discard)
2. Float precision
3. Default dict initialization
4. [Precompute powers](https://github.com/IAbeteEtMechante/Python_Tricks_for_Competitive_Programming/blob/main/Misc/precompute_powers.py)
5. [Interactive problem template](https://github.com/IAbeteEtMechante/Python_Tricks_for_Competitive_Programming/blob/main/Misc/interactive.py)

## Testing

1. Testing normal
2. Example of interactive testing for Google code jam (needs the local testing file provided by code jam for each problem)
